# README
The folder "Instances" contains a set of 999 instances generated using ``generating_PSLG_instances``. ``decompose_PSLGs`` reads one of these instances and breaks them up into rectangles.

If you want to compute the optimal decomposition, set the ``want_optimal`` variable to ``True``. If you want a vertical decomposition, set ``is_vertical_decomposition`` to ``True``.
